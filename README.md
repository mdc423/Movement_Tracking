# Movement Analysis in Noldus EthoVision

## Movement Analysis
Utilizing Noldus tracking systems, I developed an analysis based on spontaneous movement thresholds to accurately measure differences between locomotor and fine movements. 

Mouse behavior was captured by top-down and side cameras (29.97 FPS). Positions of nose, tail, and center of mass of each mouse were tracked using EthoVision XT software (Noldus). Ambulation bouts were scored post hoc as periods of >1.2cm/s movement (lasting for >0.5s and >0.5s apart) (Kravitz et al., 2010). Immobility bouts were scored by EthoVision using a criterion of >0.01% pixel change in 0.5s, lasting for >0.5s and >0.5s apart. Fine movement bouts were scored as periods where the mouse was not ambulating and not immobile lasting for >0.5s and >0.5s apart. Spontaneous locomotion was measured via distance traveled (cm) measurements. 

## Optogenetics
For all implants, optic fibers (Thorlabs), cut to length and glued inside 1.25mm ceramic ferrules, were matched for light transmission and calibrated to achieve the desired output of 1mW, measured at the tip of optic fiber cannula (PM100D, Thorlabs). Excitation of GPe and MLR was performed with constant 1mW blue light from a blue laser (473nm, LRS-0473-GFM-00100-05, Laserglow Technologies).

Animals were placed in a 19inx19in open field arena with 15in clear acrylic walls along the perimeter. Positions of nose, tail, and center of mass of each mouse were tracked using EthoVision 14.0 software (Noldus). Each trial starts with 10 minutes of habituation to measure baseline mobility before starting the treatment stimulation protocol. Continuous stimulation of 1mW blue light (465 nm, blue laser) was delivered to the sites of ChR2 expression for 30 seconds every 3 minutes, repeated 10 times. Following the treatment period, animals are left in the open field for up to 4 hours to measure therapeutic persistence of mobility.
